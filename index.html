    <h2> KAMALA HARRIS IS A ROBOT</h2>
    <p> In the 70s there was a movement started by Anarchists to infililtrate into the U.S Gov. Around the same time the<br> 
        American goverment had developed the First A.I, but was hidding it from the world. These Anarchists had a vision.<br>
        Their vision was to overthrow the goverment into a state of liberlism. The head of this Anarchist group was none <br>
        other than Joe Biden. There first creation was a humanoid robot that they wanted to get into office. Her name was <br>
        Kamala Harris.
        <br>
        They used A.I Images to create false propaganda against republicans, and to improve there "Street Cred". According to <br>
        Anthony Bicken, secretary of state, the biden adminastration is a secret cult... "Man they're doing some weird stuff back <br>
        there" They want overthrow the U.S into a state of Anarchy. We can't let this happen. Say it with me now.... <br>
